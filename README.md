## I'm Remanxnce!
I've spent the last ~16 Months mastering a few languages. Some of the key concepts I've either implemented in my projects (or plan to implement) are:
- [x] Listener/Emitter Systems
- [x] Regex Patterns
- [x] Typescript Types
- [x] SQL Operations and Queries

Alongside that, I'd also like to continue to build on those capabilities and add new skills to my portfolio. Some of those skills include:
- Linux/Shell Commands
- GoLang, Specifically for Networking
- Multithreading
- Learning more about languages and computers in general, part of which is why I made this `README` in the first place.

I've always enjoyed Creating and Developing systems and enabling ideas. I started out with Minecraft Bedrock's [Scripting API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/scriptapi/?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable), and have since grown to be fluent in Javascript as a language, and have some knowledge of other languages as well. I still interact with the same library that I started with, but it now is in a far different light - it takes a focus of networking & security.

I also have an active project to create a tutorial for newcomers to programming to understand JS and projects I've made. You can find it [Here](). It contains different folders based on APIs that I've used to understand best practices.
